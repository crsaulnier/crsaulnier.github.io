<h1>Adventures</h1>

<p>Depending on the season and the year I'm an avid climber, runner, backpacker, skier or mountaineer and you'll generally find me trying to be outside on weekends. Just as I try to challenge others as an instructor, I enjoy challenging myself and trying to find my limits. I'm known for saying yes to bad ideas (and occasionally having them myself) - so I've managed to end up on quite a few bad ideas / good adventures over the years. </p>

    <h4>Cannon Triple Crown</h4>
    <p>Labor day weekend of 2018, while finishing my dissertation, I knew I couldn't take a long weekend climbing trip like most of my friends - but I didn't want that to mean less climbing! I convinced my friend Annie H. to try and fit a whole weekend worth of climbing into a day with me. <br /><br />

    We linked together the three classic "easy" routes that climb to the top of Cannon Cliff: <a href = "https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105884815/moby-grape">Moby Grape</a> (5.8) <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106276179/lakeview">Lakeview</a> (5.6) and the <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105872668/whitney-gilman-ridge">Whitney-Gilman Ridge</a> (5.8 handcrack variation). Luck was on our side as we had sending temps and never ended up behind another party despite it being the holiday long weekend. We climbed really efficiently, especially for our first time climbing outside together! From the base of Moby Grape to our finish on the top of Whitney-Gilman (including descending back to the base of the cliff twice) took 10.5 hours. Adding in the initial approach and final descent we were less than 13 hours car to car. It was an impressive showing from Annie for her first time on Cannon after recently moving to the area! While the climbs have a total of ~22 book pitches (8 MG, 8 Lakeview, 6 WG) we had a 70m rope and used all of it a few times, allowing us finish in 15 pitches (6, 6, 3).</p>

    <h4><a href="https://nathanieldavidchu.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/climbers-superverse/">Climbers Superverse</a></h4>
    <p>On July 15-16, 2017, Nathaniel Chu and I completed a likely first "Climber's Superverse", a single-push link up in the White Mountains of New Hampshire that combined the classic hikes of a Presidential traverse and a Franconia traverse with the classic climbs of the Northeast Ridge of the Pinnacle on Washington and the Whitney-Gilman Ridge on Cannon. Stats: 12 pitches of rock, 35.3 miles of hiking, 15,780 ft of elevation gain, ~28 hours car to car, 1 bad idea, and 0 minutes of sleep. Nathaniel wrote a very entertaining <a href="https://nathanieldavidchu.wordpress.com/2017/07/16/climbers-superverse/">trip report</a>.</p>

    <h4>Failed Diretissma FKT Attempt</h4>
    <p>Jacob S. and I spent the winter of 2016 training to set a fastest known time (FKT) on the <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/articles/amc-outdoors/the-white-mountain-direttissima-summit-all-4000-footers-in-one-continuous-hike">white mountain direttissima</a>. This is a single push, unsupported, fastpacking trip linking all 48 4000 footers. At over 240 miles and somewhere north of 100,000 feet of elevation gain it's quite the undertaking. Jacob and I trained 15-20 hours a week with loaded packs, running loops and walking stairs for hours at a time. As an example, one of our "training runs" was 42 miles and 13,000 feet of elevation gain with 20lb packs over 13 hours. 

    	<br /><br />At the time the record was 8 days and we planned on breaking it by a day or two. We were shut down on day two of our attempt by a late June surprise winter storm. After spending the first day running 26.5 miles through mud, ice, slush, rain, snow, and hail with 30lb packs we woke up feeling great... with an inch of snow on our tent and a new forecast of sustained winds with gusts up to 100mph that made the safety margins too thin; a twisted ankle would quickly become a life threatening event on a ridge as we were traveling very fast and light (that pack weight is mostly food). That was our only time window for an attempt so we were not able to go back and finish what we started. Later that summer <a href="http://blog.skithewhites.com/white-mountain-direttissima/">Andrew Drummond</a> set the record that still stands. We toy with the idea of trying again, and learned a lot from the process, including the difficult experience of letting go after having external factors shut us down. <br /><br />

    	P.S. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezIqFyjAUP4&feature=youtu.be">this video</a> was taken the day we spent an hour deciding if we should try to keep going or not... which helped us feel better about our decision.

    <h4>Crossing Iceland</h4>
    <p>August 2014 Jeff C. and I hiked 665km over 24 days from the Northernmost point of Iceland to the Southernmost. Moved an average of 30km / day. Impossible to describe and full of surprises (including a snowstorm on top of a volcano, sandstorm, earthquakes, volcanic eruption on our route, and a hurricane to end things off). 
    This is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=ztEns3NAjF74.kARRYDAuTgbs">google map of our route</a>. Some day I might get around to posting more information on this spectacular route.</p>

    <h4><a href="http://saulnier.scripts.mit.edu/wp/ultra-pemi/" target="_blank">1-day (ultra) Pemi Loop</a></h4>
    <p>In 2014 as I was just getting into long distance running I ended up doing a solo overnight pemi-loop with an extra 12 miles and a thunderstorm thrown in. All told in less than 18 hours (with soaking wet boots) I ran/hiked over 43 miles with a vertical gain of over 13,000 feet. If you add in the dinner break I took between the two attempts, it was still all accomplished in less than 24 hours. Not bad for a day trip. I <a href="http://saulnier.scripts.mit.edu/wp/ultra-pemi/" target="_blank">wrote about</a> the experience.</p>
