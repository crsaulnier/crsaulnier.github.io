			<p>I'm a PhD Student at MIT interested in exploring what an authentic engineering learning environment can look like.</p>

			<p>My undergraduate degree was in Computer Engineering. Before coming to MIT I did everything but work as a Computer Engineer. First I spent a few years working full time as President and CEO of the Dalhousie Student Union. During that time I was focused on developing post-secondary education policy and advocating for it at the provincial and federal level. I spent a year as the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. After that I needed a change of pace and spent two seasons working as an Instructor for Outward Bound Canada in the Canadian Rockies. 

			<p>These experiences have brought me to where I am today - combing design education with wilderness education in weird and wonderful ways at the best place possible for that. I recently completed my Master's in Technology and Policy and am now working on an interdepartmental PhD in Engineering Education and Design. </p>

			<p>In my spare time I enjoy climbing, long distance hiking, and mountaineering. I serve on the Board of the MIT Outing Club and occasionally think about how to create unique high-school science outreach programs.</p>
