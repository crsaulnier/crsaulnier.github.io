			<h3>Rules of thumb from first principles.</h3>
			<p>Everyone who has spent any amount of time outside has heard the adage, "cotton kills". However, few have spent a lot of time thinking about why exactly that is the case.</p> 
			<p>You might wave your hands about other materials drying faster, or keeping you warm when wet, but why is that the case?</p> <p>Let's explore this, and many other questions, related to clothing layering systems for the outdoors.</p>

			<h3>Route Plan</h3>
			<p>Break the students into groups of 4-6. Have them work on a poster for the class explaining a reverse engineered product that affects heat transfer. Knowing the properties of various materials, and the type of thermoregulation that is used by the human body, a scientific explanation of layering systems is quite possible from ‘first principles’. To encourage a diversity of ideas and discussion each group could be assigned a different circumstance or product which they have to reverse engineer to describe the thermodynamic heat transfer problem and their ideal solution.</p>   

<ul><li>How can you dry your clothing in the back-country? Can you wear your clothes to dry them? Is that always a good idea?</li>
<li>How do sleeping bags work? How can you stay comfortable in different conditions?</li>
<li>How do sleeping pads work? When would you want to use different ones?</li>
<li>How can you be warm and wet? What properties should the materials have? How might the structure of the fibers affect this? Why might cotton be cold when wet but wool warm?</li></ul>

	<p>After giving the groups time to prepare their posters, have volunteers present their discussion and conclusions to the group.</p>  
	
	<p>This activity is encouraging students to apply an engineering science mindset to a real world problem to be able to better understand the why and how behind behavior that can often become rule rather than judgment based. Being able to apply this engineering science mindset in novel situations will be a reoccurring theme throughout the course, and develop within students the ability to examine a situation, define a problem, and apply scientific and technical principles to solve it in a thoughtful manner.</p>
