			<h3>Wilderness Engineering?</h3>
			<p>From 2014 to 2016 I taught and refined a wilderness engineering class with the help of my colleagues at the <a href="https://sutd.mit.edu/glp.html">MIT-SUTD Global Leadership Program</a>. Twelve trips and over 100 students later it is time to share some of the lessons we have learned along the way with the broader education community.</p> 

			<p>A wilderness engineering experience allows students to authentically engage in a design process in which they are the designers and users of artifacts engineered <i>for</i> and/or <i>in</i> a wilderness environment.</p>

			<p>Designing products <i>for</i> this unfamiliar environment forces students to think about and engage with the design process in a new and exciting way. Feedback from the natural world allows students to interact with their products at an emotional level, helping establish a deeper connection to the design process.</p>

			<p>Living and designing <i>in</i> the wilderness encourages students to interpret the natural world through a scientific lens, developing an engineering science worldview. The challenges faced by each team in this environment also creates opportunities for leadership development.</p>

			<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
			<p>Students will be able to:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>appreciate the role of engineering in daily life;</li>
				<li>interpret new problems and the natural world through the lens of engineering science;</li>
				<li>think about engineering design as a circuitous process requiring creativity, resilience, boldness, agility, courage and communication; </li>
				<li>confidently apply a design process to solve new problems;</li>
				<li>appreciate the nuances of group dynamics, effective leadership and teamwork; and</li>
				<li>have a positive experience which gets them excited about engineering.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Connection to Research</h3>
			<p>Recent work in grounded cognition has strengthened the link between physical experience and science learning<sup><a href="#cite1">1</a>,<a href="#cite2">2</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Extended wilderness experiences increase ill-structured problem solving ability<sup><a href="#cite3">3</a></sup>, a key competency for engineering students practicing design thinking<sup><a href="#cite4">4</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Leadership and communication skills are a focus of modern engineering education<sup><a href="#cite5">5</a>,<a href="#cite6">6</a></sup>. Wilderness education pedagogy supports these learning objectives, as participants in wilderness education experiences typically express long-term increased competency in leadership, teamwork, self-confidence, and communication<sup><a href="#cite7">7-9</a></sup>.</p>

			<h3>Route Plan</h3>
			
			<p>This curriculum was developed to help students develop an engineering science worldview, design thinking ability, and leadership skills; it consists of classroom and shop activities on campus, followed by a multi-day wilderness expedition. Students are challenged to design solutions to problems associated with wilderness travel, then use their products while on expedition.</p> 

			<p>While designing for and living in a wilderness environment, students are encouraged to interpret the world around them through a scientific lens, explaining natural phenomena by applying an understanding of basic scientific principles. Students are encouraged to ask why something is happening rather than just accepting the world as it is. As an example, rather than simply relying on the adage of ‘cotton kills’ when discussing expedition clothing, students examine clothing layering as a heat transfer problem, taking into account the unique properties of various materials to understand the scientific principles leading to the saying.</p>

			<p>The entire course is structured around an extended wilderness expedition. While we have taken students on expeditions of 2-4 days in length, a minimum of four days is recommended such that students are able to truly feel immersed in the environment.</p>  

			<p>Before embarking on expedition, students engage in a variety of activities on campus to prepare for the expedition and frame the learning objectives of the class. We have been experimenting with different activities over the past three years, and the curriculum resources for some of our favourite activities can be found in the sidebar. A summary of our research results provides an introduction to the scientific inquiry behind the development of this curriculum.</p>
