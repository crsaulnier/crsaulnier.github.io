			<p>From 2014 to 2017 I developed, taught, and refined a wilderness engineering class with the help of my colleagues at the <a href="https://sutd.mit.edu/glp.html">MIT-SUTD Global Leadership Program</a>. The class was created to explore alternate conceptions of authenticity in design education. After taking over 120 students on twelve wilderness expeditions we have published a variety of mixed-methods and qualitative research in 2 journal articles and 6 peer-reviewed conference publications. Before returning to consider the results of our educational experiment, I will first explain what wilderness engineering is.</p> 

			<p>A wilderness engineering experience allows students to authentically engage in a design process in which they are the designers and users of artifacts engineered <i>for</i> and/or <i>in</i> a wilderness environment.</p>

			<p>Designing products <i>for</i> this unfamiliar environment forces students to think about and engage with the design process in a new and exciting way. Feedback from the natural world allows students to interact with their products at an emotional level, helping establish a deeper connection to the design process.</p>

			<p>Living and designing <i>in</i> the wilderness encourages students to interpret the natural world through a scientific lens, developing an engineering science worldview. The challenges faced by each team in this environment also creates opportunities for leadership development.</p>

			<h3>Connection to Research</h3>
			<p>Recent work in grounded cognition has strengthened the link between physical experience and science learning<sup><a href="#cite1">1</a>,<a href="#cite2">2</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Extended wilderness experiences increase ill-structured problem solving ability<sup><a href="#cite3">3</a></sup>, a key competency for engineering students practicing design thinking<sup><a href="#cite4">4</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Leadership and communication skills are a focus of modern engineering education<sup><a href="#cite5">5</a>,<a href="#cite6">6</a></sup>. Wilderness education pedagogy supports these learning objectives, as participants in wilderness education experiences typically express long-term increased competency in leadership, teamwork, self-confidence, and communication<sup><a href="#cite7">7-9</a></sup>.</p>

			<h3>Curriculum</h3>
			
			<p>This curriculum was developed to help students develop an engineering science worldview, design thinking ability, and leadership skills; it consists of classroom and shop activities on campus, followed by a multi-day wilderness expedition. Students are challenged to design solutions to problems associated with wilderness travel, then use their products while on expedition.</p> 

			<p>While designing for and living in a wilderness environment, students are encouraged to interpret the world around them through a scientific lens, explaining natural phenomena by applying an understanding of basic scientific principles. Students are encouraged to ask why something is happening rather than just accepting the world as it is. As an example, rather than simply relying on the adage of ‘cotton kills’ when discussing expedition clothing, students examine clothing layering as a heat transfer problem, taking into account the unique properties of various materials to understand the scientific principles leading to the saying.</p>

			<p>The entire course is structured around an extended wilderness expedition. While we have taken students on expeditions of 2-4 days in length, a minimum of four days is recommended such that students are able to truly feel immersed in the environment.</p>  

			<p>Before embarking on expedition, students engage in a variety of activities on campus to prepare for the expedition and frame the learning objectives of the class. We have been experimenting with different activities over the past three years, and the curriculum resources for some of our favourite activities can be found in the sidebar. A summary of our research results provides an introduction to the scientific inquiry behind the development of this curriculum.</p>

			<h3>Results</h3>
			
			<h3>Results</h3>

			<p>Our initial exploratory work identified 8 major themes that students associated with changes in their design thinking: being flexible, the importance of high fidelity testing, the value of simplicity, the importance of trying, survival as motivation, having empathy for others, trusting the process, and identifying team strengths (Saulnier, Bagiati, et al. 2015)</p>

			One of the more direct comparisons is that the wilderness environment motivated students to appreciate simplicity through two mechanisms, constrained resources and the motivation of survival. Simple things were regarded as being more likely to work, and simple designs with limited supplies often resulted in surprisingly elegant and effective designs (Saulnier, Bagiati, et al. 2015).  A student who learns to apprechiate simplicity may be more successful in future classwork. When investigating the role of design complexity in classroom outcomes, Yang (2005) found that “prototypes with fewer parts correlate with better design outcomes, as do prototypes that have fewer parts added to them over the course of development.”
The wilderness environment also required students to consider the notion of having constrained resources. In a comparison of the use of design language by freshmen, seniors, and experts, Atman, Kilgore, and McKenna (2008) found that “identifying constraints grew in importance from the first year of an engineering education to the last, and most experts shared a perspective that this activity is important”. 
We found that students emphasized the importance of high-fidelity testing. This could indicate that students were open to failure and learning at late stages of the design process. A study by Adams, Turns, and Atman (2003) found that seniors with higher quality projects were more open to re-defining the problem throughout the entire design process, and open to the idea of failure.
For some students, the curriculum encouraged flexibility, creativity and innovation. While there is on-going research considering how to define, measure, and teach creativity as part of design thinking, there is a clear consensus that creativity plays an important role in the design process (Dorst and Cross 2001; Dym et al. 2005; Howard, Culley, and Dekoninck 2008).
