			<p>From 2014 to 2017 I developed, taught, and refined a wilderness engineering class with the help of my colleagues at the <a href="https://sutd.mit.edu/glp.html">MIT-SUTD Global Leadership Program</a>. The class was created to explore alternate conceptions of authenticity in design education. After taking over 120 students on twelve wilderness expeditions we have published a variety of mixed-methods and qualitative research in 2 journal articles and 6 peer-reviewed conference publications. Before returning to consider the results of our educational experiment, I will first explain what wilderness engineering is.</p> 

			<p>A wilderness engineering experience allows students to authentically engage in a design process in which they are the designers and users of artifacts engineered <i>for</i> and/or <i>in</i> a wilderness environment.</p>

			<p>Designing products <i>for</i> this unfamiliar environment forces students to think about and engage with the design process in a new and exciting way. Feedback from the natural world allows students to interact with their products at an emotional level, helping establish a deeper connection to the design process.</p>

			<p>Living and designing <i>in</i> the wilderness encourages students to interpret the natural world through a scientific lens, developing an engineering science worldview. The challenges faced by each team in this environment also creates opportunities for leadership development.</p>

			<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
			<p>Students will be able to:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>appreciate the role of engineering in daily life;</li>
				<li>interpret new problems and the natural world through the lens of engineering science;</li>
				<li>think about engineering design as a circuitous process requiring creativity, resilience, boldness, agility, courage and communication; </li>
				<li>confidently apply a design process to solve new problems;</li>
				<li>appreciate the nuances of group dynamics, effective leadership and teamwork; and</li>
				<li>have a positive experience which gets them excited about engineering.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Connection to Research</h3>
			<p>Recent work in grounded cognition has strengthened the link between physical experience and science learning<sup><a href="#cite1">1</a>,<a href="#cite2">2</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Extended wilderness experiences increase ill-structured problem solving ability<sup><a href="#cite3">3</a></sup>, a key competency for engineering students practicing design thinking<sup><a href="#cite4">4</a></sup>.</p> 

			<p>Leadership and communication skills are a focus of modern engineering education<sup><a href="#cite5">5</a>,<a href="#cite6">6</a></sup>. Wilderness education pedagogy supports these learning objectives, as participants in wilderness education experiences typically express long-term increased competency in leadership, teamwork, self-confidence, and communication<sup><a href="#cite7">7-9</a></sup>.</p>
