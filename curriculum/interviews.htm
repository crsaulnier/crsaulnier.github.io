			<h3>Research</h3>

			<p>To support program evaluation and future curriculum development a variety of mixed-methods studies were performed over the four years the program took place. Methods used included pre- and post-testing (survey instruments), field observations, interviews (grounded theory analysis), categorization and analysis of student artifacts, and quasi-experiments between class sections. In the following sections I'll highlight three separate investigations into the wilderness engineering experience that relied on three different methods: interview analysis, pre- and post-testing, and mixed-method analysis of a quasi-experiment. 

			<h3>Exploratory Interview Analysis</h3>

			<p style="font-size: smaller; padding: 10px 60px 20px 20px; text-align: justify">C.R. Saulnier, A. Bagiati, B. Ahn, J.G. Brisson. (2015, July). Changes in Design Thinking through Participation in Design Based Wilderness Education. <i>In Proceedings of the 6th Research in Engineering Education Symposium (REES 2015): Translating Research into Practice</i>. Dublin, Ireland.</p>

			<p>An exploratory study was performed in 2014 to investigate <i>what elements of design thinking are emphasized while designing in and for a natural environment</i> and <i>which, if any, of the themes align with recognized effective practices</i>?</p> 

			<p>After completing the course, 34 of 36 students participated in exit interviews during which they were asked to reflect upon their learning experience while participating in the curriculum and to compare the class to previous design experiences. The interview transcripts were analyzed using a constructivist grounded theory approach<sup>10</sup>.</p>       

			 <p>We identified eight major themes that students associated with changes in their design thinking: being flexible, the importance of high fidelity testing, the value of simplicity, the importance of trying, survival as motivation, having empathy for others, trusting the process, and identifying team strengths</p>

			<p>Considering the theme <i>the value of simplicity</i> further, the wilderness environment motivated students to appreciate simplicity through two mechanisms, constrained resources and the motivation of survival. Simple things were regarded as being more likely to work, and simple designs with limited supplies often resulted in surprisingly elegant and effective designs. As one student put it, <i>"you aren’t limited by your materials, you’re just limited by the way you think.”</i></p>  

			<p>A student who learns to appreciate simplicity may be more successful in future classwork. When investigating the role of design complexity in classroom outcomes, Yang<sup>11</sup> found that “prototypes with fewer parts correlate with better design outcomes, as do prototypes that have fewer parts added to them over the course of development.”</p>

			<p>The study also explores links between recognized effective design practices and student emphasis of the importance of high fidelity testing, considering constraints, and creativity. The results of this study were used to guide future curriculum development and identify future research questions.</p>
