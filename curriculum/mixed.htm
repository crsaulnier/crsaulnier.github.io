			<h3>Mixed Methods Quasi-Experiment</h3>

			<p style="font-size: smaller; padding: 10px 60px 20px 20px; text-align: justify">C.R. Saulnier, J.G. Brisson. (2018). Design for Use: A Case Study of an Authentically Impactful Design Experience. <i>International Journal of Engineering Education</i>, 34(2B), 769-779.</p>

			<p>The conjecture underlying this curriculum is that students learn differently (and better?) when their actions have impact outside of the classroom. We wanted to take a closer look at the stove project as:</p>

			<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
				<li>In most cases, the students are designing for an alien environment.</li>
				<li>Students directly observe the impact of their efforts on themselves and others.</li> 
				<li>Failure has direct consequences for the student (they may have to eat cold meals).</li>
			</ul>


<p>We hypothesized that students would be motivated to generate a higher quality artifact when designing a stove for someone else to use. To investigate this we used a quasi-experimental research design. The students were divided into two classroom sections and the user of the stove was varied. Half the students used their own stove and half the students gave their stoves to someone else to use.</p>     

<p>We sought to understand how (if at all) the quasi-experimental condition influenced: a) the quality of the final product and b) the learning outcomes emphasized by the experience. The analysis was divided into two parts. First, an analysis of the students’ stoves provided an indication of the technical complexity, quality, and use of the stoves during the expedition. The second half of the analysis used interviews to provide insight into the experience of students while participating in the project.</p> 

<p>Using the information from sketches (n=29), interviews with stove designers (n=30), interviews with stove receivers (n=14), photographs of prototypes (n=11), and email communication (n=4), information was gathered on 35 unique stoves. Of the 35 stoves identified, seventeen were used by the stove’s designer and eighteen were used by a student other than the designer</p><br /><br />

			<center><div style="display: inline-block; margin: auto; padding: auto; text-align: left"><img src ="example.png" height = "600px"><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt; margin-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; text-align: left; align: left; display: inline-block">Figure 7: common stoves and their operation</span></div></center><br />

<p>All of the information available for each stove was used to categorize the stove into one of five categories of roughly increasing conceptual and physical complexity. Figure 6 provides a guide to the five categories of stove identified for analysis. Category 1 and 2 stoves are essentially an open flame. Category 3, 4, and 5 stoves each use enclosed chambers in some way to take advantage of the high vapor pressure of denatured alcohol to create pressurized jets of fuel. These stoves are more conceptually complex than Category 1 and 2 stoves and require more precise assembly. Figure 7 provides examples of common stoves and their operation.</p>


			<p>Along with determining the category of the stove, the interview process was used to determine if the stove:</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 20px">
<li>worked for the designer of the stove;</li> 
<li>was brought on the expedition;</li>
<li>worked for the external user (if designed for someone else); and</li>
<li>was regularly used to cook meals during the expedition.</li>
</ul>

			

<p>The complete interviews were also analyzed with an open-coding scheme that was then sorted into thematic groups, the results of the thematic coding was analyzed as two separate batches, students who designed a stove for themselves and students who designed a stove for someone else, to determine if there were any differences in the learning outcomes or constructed experience of the two groups of students. Our analysis focused on the differences between the quasi-experimental groups.</p>

<p>There were no differences in the types of stoves between the two groups of students. We also did not find that students were more motivated when designing a stove for someone else. Instead most students were motivated by the impactful nature of the project, the creativity the project afforded, or a sense of personal accomplishment</p>

<p>However, this comes with a caveat, students think we're lying. Year after year students do not believe that we are telling the truth and that they will have to use their stoves while on the expedition.</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; padding: 10px 60px 20px 20px; text-align: justify"><i>"I thought there would be a backup stove! I was like, ‘No way they're gonna let us just die or make us eat raw rice and vegetables.’ … nature and [the Instructor] are ruthless! No mercy!"
</i></p><br /><br />

<p>This is a noteworthy finding and highlights the difficulty in designing curricular elements with authentic outside of the classroom impact. Students are so used to educational experiences being contrived and sometimes even dishonest <sup>13, pp. 38–54</sup> that their natural reaction when presented with an authentic and impactful project was to doubt the truth of the underlying premise.</p>

<p>We found that students using stoves they designed for themselves had a far easier time using the stoves to cook their meals while on expedition. Students using a stove designed by someone else struggled and focused on the challenges faced while getting the stove to work. In many cases, they concluded that the stove would not work.</p> 

<p>The students who struggled using a stove made by someone else were forced to consider the perspective of a user of their own product:</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; padding: 10px 60px 20px 20px; text-align: justify"><i>“I think [this is] helpful as an engineer because sometimes you design something, and somehow it goes wrong. <b>You cannot assume that it's the fault of the consumer.</b> You should make your design as foolproof as possible. It helped me appreciate that.”</i>
<br /><br />

<i>“I guess that's what's important when you design for other people. We had to make it fool... not foolproof, but idiot-friendly [...]. The most accessible products usually have very little instruction. It’s quite intuitive. But that, in itself, is quite a hard thing to do[.]”</i></p>			

<p>The most significant contribution of impact-authentic experiences to design education may be that students are able to better understand and appreciate the relationship between designer and user. This is made possible by the authentic integration of using into the learning environment – a curricular approach of <i>design for use</i>. Use may help to increase students’ understanding of human-centered design principles by both using products themselves and receiving feedback from users of their products.</p> 

<p>In this case, it appeared that greater opportunity for learning occurred when students were using products designed by their classmates. The stoves that students built are simple things, and the difficulty faced by students when they were acting as external users of a product they thought they understood clearly illuminated the challenges associated with effective human-centered design.</p>
