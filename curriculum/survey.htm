			<h3>Pre- and Post-testing (Survey Instruments)</h3>

The importance of doing rather than discussing: how curricular changes affected student design-task prioritization in a hands-on design project. <i>In Proceedings of the 2017 American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference & Exposition.</i> Columbus, Ohio.</p>

			<p>A series of two studies explored how student design thinking changed after participation in the wilderness engineering class in 2015 and 2016. In 2015 a pre- and post-assessment was given to students immediately before and shortly after participating in the class. The assessment consisted of an inventory of 23 activities associated with the design process; students were asked to identify the six most and the six least important activities.</p> 

				<p>This inventory  was used to help understand the learning outcomes students associated with the design class. An example of the format of the design question is given in Figure 4. This inventory was developed by Mosborg, Adams, and Kim as a component of a study exploring expert perception of the design process<sup>12</sup>.</p>

			<p>As you can see in Figure 5, after the 2015 class we found that students tended to place increased importance on tasks related to immediate action such as building, planning, and making decisions. At the same time, decreased importance was placed on exploratory tasks such as understanding the problem, iterating, and prototyping. This was contrary to our expected results as the curriculum was originally developed with the intention of emphasizing the importance of understanding the problem and iterating.</p> 

			<p>This shift towards an emphasis on action-orientated activities may be a reflection of the rapid pace of the curriculum, along with its underlying structure. As mentioned previously, students were assigned tasks or design-problems such as building a stove or designing a thermal desalination artifact. These tasks were fairly straightforward (or at least appeared to be so), and therefore did not require students to place significant emphasis on understanding the problem.</p>

			<p>The stove design activity had been chosen specifically as it provided the opportunity for students to engage in rapid prototyping. With limited experience a working stove could be made in as little as 15 minutes. Students had the opportunity to build multiple stoves while on campus over two shop sessions.</p> 

			<p>However, exploring a solution space through multiple prototypes did not appear to be the process adopted by students. Instead of building multiple prototypes and iterating to a final ‘best’ design, students would build a stove, test it, and if it worked would stick with that model. If the stove did not work, or did not work well, students would then try and modify their current stove to make it work.</p>

			<p>Instead of seeing rapid prototyping and iteration as a means to achieve a high quality final product, students were attempting to complete a ‘final product’ on the first attempt. As the materials that could be used for prototyping and the final product were the same, a lack of separation between what could be considered a prototype and what could be considered a final product may have led students to not recognize that their failures along the way were in fact prototypes developed during an iterative design process and not simply failed final products.</p>

			<p>To address these concerns the 2016 curriculum was modified with these findings in mind, increasing the time spent discussing exploratory aspects of the design process and increasing the number of opportunities for students to iterate on designs.</p>

			<p>As you can see in Table 5, between the pre- and post-assessment in 2016, a statistically significant number of students still stopped identifying understanding the problem as one of the most important design-tasks. This is despite an attempt to modify the curriculum to prevent this learning outcome. The change in curriculum focused on discussion during lecture-style classroom encounters. Explicitly discussing the importance of understating the problem, and spending additional time at the beginning of the class exploring relevant scientific phenomena and establishing desired functional requirements did not contribute to students continuing to prioritize the importance of understanding the problem. </p>

			<p>There was a small, but not significant, increase in the number of students who identified iterating as one of the most important design tasks after being provided increased opportunity to practice iterating. Having students spending more time actively iterating during the course, especially during the expedition, appeared to maintain students perspective of the importance of iteration.</p>

	<p>This brings us to an intuitive conclusion, that actions speak louder than words. This adage may be particularly important to keep in mind when developing experiential design-based curricula. In this case, we observed that students spending time performing a specific design task (iterating) was associated with students later emphasizing its importance. On the other hand, spending more time just discussing a specific design task in a lecture format (understanding the problem) was not associated with students continuing to emphasize its importance.</p>

	<p>When developing curriculum around a task as complex as the engineering design process it is difficult to ensure that desired learning outcomes emerge from the experience. Perhaps the most important lesson learned was that student perception of activities may contribute greatly to the learning outcomes. If students perceive themselves as repeatedly trying to build a final product, they may not recognize that they are engaged in an iterative prototyping process.</p>
