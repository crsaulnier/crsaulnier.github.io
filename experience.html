              </i></p><br />
              <p>Served as technical lead and engineering director for a hardware startup through multiple rounds of VC funding including an $8.5M Series A. Core member of the team that transformed Nirrin from an R&D-centric startup with three employees to a product-focused organization with a team of 20 building next-generation instruments for use in biopharma manufacturing.</p> 

<p><b>Engineering Leadership</b></p> 
<p>Built the product development team, hiring mechanical, electrical, software engineers and data scientists, while simultaneously writing proposals for and managing engagements with multiple product development consulting firms to augment our internal resources and accelerate development timelines of multiple product lines.</p>
<p>Implemented agile methodologies and established appropriate engineering controls to launch a lab instrument meeting the requirements for IEC 61010 and 21 CFR Part 11.</p> 
<p>Leading the engineering team through building their first commercial product, working closely with the Director of Product Management to ensure the instrument met customer and business needs while being designed for manufacturability and transferred to a contract manufacturer.</p>  

<p><b>Technical Leadership</b></p> 
<p>Initially served as the sole electrical and software engineer, taking full responsibility for the design, development, and implementation of electronics and software for early-stage prototypes of spectroscopic instruments for use in biomanufacturing processes.</p>
<p>Served as technical lead for the company, evaluating and selecting appropriate technologies and engineering approaches to balance cost, manufacturability, long term support, and business needs.</p>
<p>Personally developed custom high-precision circuit boards for multiple potential product offerings, custom firmware, web-based user interfaces, control systems for critical parameters of fed batch and perfusion cell cultures, and data acquisition software for recording spectroscopic data and directly feeding that data into chemometric models.</p>

<p><b>Product Leadership</b></p>
<p>Collaborated directly with customers to understand their needs and specifications, leading to the development of multiple customized prototypes tailored to solve specific challenges.</p>
<p>Conducted on-site experiments at client locations, utilizing these opportunities to gather critical feedback and insights directly from the end users and operational environments.</p>

    <p>As an engineer and ice climber living in Boston, I got tired of obsessively watching weather forecasts to decide where to climb on the weekends. <a href="https://ice.report">ice.report</a> weaves together historical weather observations and forecasts to create a single stop for ice conditions forcasting.</p>

    <p>This project was also an excuse to play around with some technologies that seemed useful. The site is written using Plotly Dash and deployed serverlessly on AWS Lambda using Zappa. This is a little slower but lets me keep the cost of hosting the site at around a dollar a month.</p>
