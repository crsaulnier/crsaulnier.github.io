        <p>At <a href="http://nirrin.tech">Nirrin Technologies</a> and through a strategic secondment by <a href="http://anzupartners.com">Anzu Partners</a>, Chris was the technical lead driving new product introduction efforts while building and scaling engineering teams from the ground up. His leadership extended across technical leadership, hiring, team development, and process optimization, incorporating Agile methodologies that significantly improved product development cycles.
        </p>    
        <p>Chris' direct engagement with customers and hands-on approach while developing prototype instruments for monitoring and controlling biomanufacturing processes underscored his commitment to delivering impactful, customer-centric solutions. Over the past year, in collaboration with the Sr. Director of Product Management, the engineering team concentrated on the design for manufacturability (DFM) of nirrin's first commercial instrument. This focused effort led to the successful transfer of the instrument to a contract manufacturer for its inaugural production run in April.</p>

         <p>Prior to joining Anzu Partners, Chris was awarded a PhD from MIT in the field of Product Design. Chris' background uniquely qualifies him for working at the nexus of complex systems. While his PhD research was based in the Mechanical Engineering Department, his original training and early work experiences were in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Particularly concerned with the human side of technical problem solving, Chris also has a master's degree in technology and policy from MIT and a strong background in leadership development and experiential education. 
            		 
		 <p>In his spare time Chris enjoys climbing, long distance hiking, and mountaineering.</p>
