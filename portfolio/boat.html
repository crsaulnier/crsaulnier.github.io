<h1>Stitch and Glue Kayak Design and Construction</h1>

   <p id="text">During the summer of 2015 we developed a new design class that would have students design and build electric boats that they would race around the charles river as an 8-week class. I took on the task of determining how quickly a hull could reasonably be designed and constructed. To accomplish this I first built a sea-kayak from a prefabricated kit in approximately 2 weeks to learn stitch-and-glue construction techniques (John Brisson did most of the finishing over an extended period). I then modeled my own kayak in Rhino3D and built the front section as a teaching model using a ShopBot to cut the required plywood shapes.</p>
