   <p id="text">While taking MAS.863, the MIT Media Lab class better known as <i>How to Make (Almost) Anything</i> I individually developed and prototyped a location aware trekking pole. The final prototype was built using 3D printing, casting, composite thermomolding, and custom circuit board design and production via milling. The custom circuit boards were my own design consisting of arduino compatible boards built around an Atmega328P, using an nRF24L01+ for RF communication and the MTK3339 GPS Module alongside an OLED screen for output.</p>

As something that is always already in your hands, they are an excellent target for technological augmentation. While an experienced navigator has a whole handbag of tricks to draw from when determining direction of travel, sometimes the only way to be sure is by constantly being aware of subtle clues such as the position of the sun. An augmented trekking pole could be useful for maintaining awareness of direction of travel for experts in safety-critical situations and recreationalists while learning and practicing basic navigational skills. The individual pieces were modeled in solidworks, modified from a commercially available pole, while developing the concept.';" alt="" title="" border="" >

This was challenging but fun. I used a few tricks to make the board small, the most notable being running a few traces under pins on the processor to reduce some of the routing that would have otherwise had to run outside of the board. Being able to mill and hand solder my own boards from copper-coated sheets allowed me to rapidly move through board revisions. ';" alt="" title="" border="">

The inner and outer wraps were made tightly around a steel rod by hand, and the middle wrap consisted of fibers running up and down the length of the shaft to give it strength along its main axis. A wrap of silicone around the outside provided compaction against the inner surface and while the thermoplastic was baked for an hour at 450 degrees.';" alt="" title="" border="">
