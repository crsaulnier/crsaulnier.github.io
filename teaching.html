  <p>MIT Mechanical Engineering | Mentor (Fall 2017)</p>
  <p>In 2.009, Product Engineering Processes, students work in large teams of approximately 15-20 individuals to design and build working alpha prototypes of new products. Students learn about creativity, product design, working within a budget, and gain unifying engineering experience. The course is designed to emulate what engineers might experience as part of a design team in a modern product development firm. Each team has ~4 mentors that are professionals with product development experience. They assist with a wide variety of issues, ranging from technical details, to team organization and business models. The mentors can be thought of as experienced advisors, as is common for startup companies.
