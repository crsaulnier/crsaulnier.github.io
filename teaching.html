  <p>MIT Mechanical Engineering | Mentor (Fall 2017)</p>
  <p>In 2.009, Product Engineering Processes, students work in large teams of approximately 15-20 individuals to design and build working alpha prototypes of new products. Students learn about creativity, product design, working within a budget, and gain unifying engineering experience. The course is designed to emulate what engineers might experience as part of a design team in a modern product development firm. Each team has ~4 mentors that are professionals with product development experience. They assist with a wide variety of issues, ranging from technical details, to team organization and business models. The mentors can be thought of as experienced advisors, as is common for startup companies.

  <h4>2.00 Introduction to Design</a></h4>
  <p>MIT Mechanical Engineering | Lab Instructor (Fall 2017)</p>
  <p>Project-based introduction to product development and engineering design. Emphasizes key elements of the design process, including defining design problems, generating ideas, and building solutions. Presents a range of design techniques to help students think about, evaluate, and communicate designs, from sketching to physical prototyping, as well as other types of modeling. Students work both individually and in teams. Each team is paired with a lab instructor who is a professor, graduate student, or industry representative with an established background in product design.</p>

  <h4>Adventure Education High School Physics Outreach</h4>
  <p>I teamed up with Outward Bound Thompson Island and the MIT Outing Club to develop a high school outreach program using low-rope and high-rope challenge course elements to discuss physics topics in a fun way. The project received funding from the National Forest Service and Outdoor Nation. The initial curriculum was prototyped with a group of Grade 9 students from the (Boston) Urban Science Academy. We presented results from this program at the 2017 Association of Experiential Education (AEE) Northeast Regional Conference.</p>
